In this project I have converted an app for fetching and saving books from the Google Books API from a RESTful API to GraphQL. The primary purpose of this application is to demonstrate the use of GraphQL and Appollo to make a more flexible and efficient API. 
The app is built with React so the UI updates dynamically without the need for page reloads after fetching data from the Google Books API and our MongoDB database. 
Requests made to our database are handled by an Apollo Provider and Server.
When logged in, the user is allowed to save books they search for to their bookshelf where they can access them later. 
When they've read the book the user can delete the book from their bookshelf.

## Installation

No installation necessary, just open the link to the app.
